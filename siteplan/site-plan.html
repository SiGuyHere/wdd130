        Welcome to the Honkai Star Rail 5 star character builds website. The purpose of this site is to show what exactly are the best builds, trace orders, and ways to play each 5 star character currently in the game. We will have a section for each damage type, those being Quantum, Imaginary, Physical, Fire, Wind, Ice, or Lightning. As there aren’t that many different 5 stars currently, we will not be separating them into their different paths. We will also only be covering characters and relics that are currently in the game, not coming out in the future. This site will include builds for Seele(Quantum, Hunt), Silver Wolf(Quantum, Nihility), Fu Xuan(Quantum, Preservation), Welt(Imaginary, Nihility), Luocha(Imaginary, Abundance), Imbibitor Lunae(Imaginary, Destruction),Clara(Physical, Destruction), Trailblazer(Physical, Destruction), Himeko(Fire, Erudition), Trailblazer(Fire, Preservation), Topaz(Fire, Hunt),Bronya(Wind, Harmony), Blade(Wind, Destruction), Gepard(Ice, Preservation), Yanqing(Ice, Hunt), Jingliu(Ice, Destruction), Bailu(Lightning, Abundance), Jing Yuan(Lightning, Erudition),  and Kafka(Lightning, Nihility). We will be going into more details about certain relic sets and why they are better, as well as what is the best way to play the character.

      <h3>How to Use</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the How to Use page. On this page we will be going over what each character does, their roles in team comps, as well as how strong they are overall, with a rank of C, B, A, and S. We will be assuming you have a level 80, E0 Character. Starting with Seele, Seele is a A rank damage dealer. She deals massive amounts of Quantum damage, getting another turn every time she kills an enemy.  Her basic ability is Thwack, dealing Quantum DMG equal to 110% of Seele’s ATK to a single enemy. Her active ability is Sheathed Blade, which increases Seele’s SPD by 25% for 2 turns, and deals Quantum DMG equal to 242% of Seele’s ATK to a single enemy. Her talent ability is Resurgence. Seele enters the buffed state upon defeating an enemy with her basic, active, or ultimate, and receives an extra turn. While in the buffed state, the DMG of Seele’s attacks increases by 88% for 1 turn. Enemies defeated in the extra turn provided by this ability will not trigger another extra turn. Her ultimate is Butterfly Flurry, where she enters the buffed state and deals Quantum DMG equal to 442% of Seele’s ATK to a single enemy. Her Technique is called Phantom Illusion. When she uses her technique, Seele gains Stealth for 20 secs. While this is active, Seele cannot be detected by enemies. And when entering battle by attacking enemies, Seele will immediately enter the buffed state. Due to Seele’s Ability to get multiple turns in a row, she makes both a great single damage dealer, as well as a multi damage dealer as she can attack different enemies on her different turns. Overall a very strong character. Etc etc
