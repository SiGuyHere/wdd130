        <h2>My name is Silas Riday</h2>
        <p>I'm Silas. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I think it will be interesting to learn about what goes into creating websites and making them look nice.</p>
        <p>The things I enjoy doing are as follows; watching anime, playing video games, and climb(indoors only). <br>Some of my favorite shows include: March comes in like a Lion, Sonny Boy, and Ponyo.<br>
        Some of my favorite games to play are Overwatch, LoL(im sorry), and any Gamecube games.</p>
        <p>During the summers I work as a lifeguard at my school pool. It pays decently well so I enjoy it. If you are wondering why I am still pale it is because it is an indoor pool.</p>
