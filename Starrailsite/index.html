                <h1>The Honkai Starrail Character Builds Site</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Honkai Star Rail 5 star character builds website. The purpose of this site is to show what exactly are the best builds, trace orders, and ways to play each 5 star character currently in the game. We will have a section for each damage type, those being Quantum, Imaginary, Physical, Fire, Wind, Ice, or Lightning. As there arenâ€™t that many different 5 stars currently, we will not be separating them into their different paths. We will also only be covering characters and relics that are currently in the game, not coming out in the future. This site will include builds for Seele(Quantum, Hunt), Silver Wolf(Quantum, Nihility), Fu Xuan(Quantum, Preservation), Welt(Imaginary, Nihility), Luocha(Imaginary, Abundance), Imbibitor Lunae(Imaginary, Destruction),Clara(Physical, Destruction), Trailblazer(Physical, Destruction), Himeko(Fire, Erudition), Trailblazer(Fire, Preservation), Topaz(Fire, Hunt),Bronya(Wind, Harmony), Blade(Wind, Destruction), Gepard(Ice, Preservation), Yanqing(Ice, Hunt), Jingliu(Ice, Destruction), Bailu(Lightning, Abundance), Jing Yuan(Lightning, Erudition), and Kafka(Lightning, Nihility). We will be going into more details about certain relic sets and why they are better, as well as what is the best way to play the character. </p>
