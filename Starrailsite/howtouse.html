                <p>Huohuo is a S rank sustain character. Huohuo specializes in supportive and control abilities. Her basic attack inflicts Wind damage equivalent to 25% of her max HP on a target enemy. The skill dispels a debuff from a single ally, immediately restoring their HP and providing adjacent allies with healing based on percentages of Huohuo's max HP. Her ultimate replenishes Energy for all allies and enhances their ATK for 2 turns. Huohuo's talent, Divine Provision, triggers healing for allies at the start of their turn or upon using their ultimate, dispelling one debuff in the process and applying to allies with 50% HP or lower. The technique induces Horror-Struck on surrounding enemies, compelling them to flee from Huohuo for 10 seconds, and entering battle with Horror-Struck enemies reduces the ATK of every enemy by 25% for 2 turns. Huohuo's comprehensive abilities make her a valuable support character with healing, debuff removal, and crowd control attributes for the team.</p>

                <p>Yanqing is a C rank damage dealer. Yanqing's abilities are tailored for ice damage and critical hits. His basic attack deals Ice damage equal to 50% of his ATK to a single enemy. The skill intensifies this, dealing Ice damage equal to 110% of Yanqing's ATK to a single enemy while activating Soulsteel Sync for 1 turn. The ultimate amplifies Yanqing's CRIT Rate by 60%, and when Soulsteel Sync is active, his CRIT DMG receives an additional 30%, lasting for one turn. Subsequently, the ultimate deals substantial Ice damage equal to 210% of Yanqing's ATK to a single enemy. Yanqing's talent makes him less likely to be targeted during Soulsteel Sync, increasing his CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG. After attacking, there's a fixed chance for a follow-up attack, dealing Ice damage and potentially Freezing the enemy for 1 turn. If Yanqing receives damage, the Soulsteel Sync effect vanishes. His technique, when used, enhances his damage output for 2 turns against enemies with 50% or higher current HP at the start of the next battle.

                <p>Jingliu is a S rank damage dealer. Jingliu's abilities revolve around ice damage and the unique mechanic of Syzygy. Her basic attack deals Ice damage equal to 50% of her ATK to a single enemy. The skill inflicts Ice damage equal to 100% of Jingliu's ATK to a single enemy and accumulates 1 stack of Syzygy. The enhanced skill consumes 1 stack of Syzygy, dealing increased Ice damage to the target and adjacent enemies without using Skill Points. Jingliu's ultimate delivers substantial Ice damage to a single enemy and adjacent foes, gaining 1 Syzygy stack after the attack. Her talent introduces the Spectral Transmigration state when Jingliu has 2 stacks of Syzygy, boosting her CRIT Rate and granting an Action Advance of 100%. In this state, her attacks consume HP from allies but significantly increase her ATK based on the total HP consumed. Syzygy can stack up to 3 times, depleting with each use and causing Jingliu to exit the Spectral Transmigration state. Her technique creates a dimension, freezing all enemies within it. Entering combat in this dimension grants Energy, a Syzygy stack, and a chance to Freeze enemy targets. The frozen enemies suffer additional Ice damage at the start of each turn. Jingliu's playstyle combines ice-based attacks, Syzygy mechanics, and strategic freezing effects.</p>
